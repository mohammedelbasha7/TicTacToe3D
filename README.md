# TicTacToe3D
This is a game of 3D Tic Tac Toe. The game is played on a 3x3x3 board, consisting of 3 planes (or levels), each with 3 rows and 3 columns.

The game is played by two players, X and O, who take turns placing their mark on the board. The first player to get three marks in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on any of the three planes (top to bottom, left to right, front to back) or diagonally through the cube, wins the game.

If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.

## How to Play
The player who is X goes first and places their X in any empty square on the grid.
The player who is O goes next and places their O in any empty square on the 3 grid.
Players take turns placing their X or O until one player gets three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on any of the three planes (top to bottom, left to right, front to back) or diagonally through the cube.
If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
